Hello GitHubers!

I have no coding experience. I taught myself a rudimentary amount of HTML years ago but have not used it must since then. I received a Pebble Time Round for Christmas & am curious about creating my own watchfaces, playing around with programs to see if I can customize something & generally I'm just curious.
